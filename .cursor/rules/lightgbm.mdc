*   **data/**: Contains raw, processed, and external data.
*   **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation.
*   **src/**: Source code for data loading, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
*   **tests/**: Unit and integration tests.
*   **configs/**: Configuration files (e.g., YAML).
*   **reports/**: Generated reports and figures.

### 1.2 File Naming Conventions

*   Python files: `lowercase_with_underscores.py`
*   Jupyter notebooks: `descriptive_name.ipynb`
*   Configuration files: `config.yaml` or `config.json`
*   Data files: `data_description.csv` or `data_description.parquet`

### 1.3 Module Organization

*   Group related functions and classes into modules.
*   Use clear and descriptive module names.
*   Minimize dependencies between modules.

### 1.4 Component Architecture

*   **Data Layer:** Handles data loading, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
*   **Model Layer:** Encapsulates model training, evaluation, and prediction.
*   **Service Layer:** Exposes model functionality through an API or interface.
*   **Configuration Layer:** Manages configuration parameters and settings.

### 1.5 Code Splitting

*   Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable functions.
*   Use classes to encapsulate related data and behavior.
*   Avoid long functions and deeply nested code blocks.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 2.1 Design Patterns

*   **Factory Pattern:** To create different LightGBM models based on configuration.
*   **Strategy Pattern:** To implement different feature engineering techniques.
*   **Observer Pattern:** To monitor training progress and log metrics.

### 2.2 Recommended Approaches

*   **Data Preparation:** Utilize LightGBM's native support for missing values and categorical features. Convert categorical features to the `categorical` data type in pandas before splitting the data.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization (e.g., Optuna) to optimize hyperparameters. Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.
*   **Model Monitoring:** Track training and validation performance metrics to detect overfitting and adjust model complexity.
*   **Feature Selection:** Use feature importance to identify and select relevant features.
*   **Cross-Validation:** Use k-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation.  The `cv` function provides mean metrics and standard deviations across folds.

### 2.3 Anti-patterns and Code Smells

*   **Hardcoding hyperparameters:**  Avoid hardcoding; use configuration files.
*   **Ignoring missing values:** LightGBM handles missing values, so explicitly using them is fine, but ensure you understand their impact.
*   **Overfitting:**  Monitor training vs. validation performance and use regularization.
*   **Large, monolithic functions:**  Break down into smaller, testable units.
*   **Ignoring feature importances:** Use feature importance to help drive feature selection and understand your model.

### 2.4 State Management

*   Use configuration files to manage model parameters and training settings.
*   Store model artifacts (e.g., trained models, scalers) in a designated directory.
*   Use version control to track changes to code and data.

### 2.5 Error Handling

*   Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential exceptions.
*   Log errors and warnings using a logging library (e.g., `logging`).
*   Provide informative error messages to the user.
*   Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors.

## 3. Performance Considerations

### 3.1 Optimization Techniques

*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of leaves, and tree depth.
*   **Early Stopping:** Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting and reduce training time.
*   **Parallel Training:** Enable parallel training for faster computations (data/feature/voting parallel).
*   **GPU Acceleration:**  Enable GPU usage for accelerated training when possible.
*   **Feature Selection:** Remove irrelevant or redundant features to improve performance.
*   **Reduce data size:** Consider downcasting numerical types (e.g., float64 to float32) if precision loss is acceptable.
*   **Histogram-based algorithms:**  LightGBM uses histogram-based algorithms for faster training on large datasets. 

### 3.2 Memory Management

*   **`max_bin` Parameter:** Reduce `max_bin` to decrease memory usage (may impact accuracy).
*   **`save_binary` Parameter:** Use `save_binary` to save data in a binary format for faster loading and reduced memory usage.
*   **Data Types:** Use appropriate data types to minimize memory footprint (e.g., `int32` instead of `int64`).
*   **Garbage Collection:**  Explicitly call `gc.collect()` to free up unused memory.

### 3.3 Bundle Size Optimization (If applicable for deployment)

*   Remove unnecessary dependencies.
*   Use code minification and compression techniques.
*   Optimize image assets.

### 3.4 Lazy Loading

*   Load data and models only when needed.
*   Use generators to process large datasets in chunks.

## 4. Security Best Practices

### 4.1 Common Vulnerabilities

*   **Untrusted Input:** Vulnerable to injection attacks if model is used directly on user-provided data without sanitization.
*   **Model Poisoning:** If training data is sourced from untrusted sources, the model can be poisoned.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious input crafted to consume excessive resources.

### 4.2 Input Validation

*   Validate input data to ensure it conforms to expected types and ranges.
*   Sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks.
*   Use a schema validation library (e.g., `cerberus`, `jsonschema`).

### 4.3 Authentication and Authorization

*   Implement authentication to verify the identity of users.
*   Use authorization to control access to resources and functionality.
*   Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for API communication.

### 4.4 Data Protection

*   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
*   Use data masking to protect sensitive information.
*   Implement access controls to restrict access to data.

### 4.5 Secure API Communication

*   Use HTTPS for all API communication.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization.
*   Use rate limiting to prevent abuse.
*   Monitor API traffic for suspicious activity.

## 5. Testing Approaches

### 5.1 Unit Testing

*   Test individual functions and classes in isolation.
*   Use mocking and stubbing to isolate dependencies.
*   Write tests for different input scenarios and edge cases.
*   Verify expected outputs and side effects.

### 5.2 Integration Testing

*   Test interactions between different components.
*   Verify data flow and consistency.
*   Test API endpoints and data pipelines.

### 5.3 End-to-End Testing

*   Test the entire application flow from start to finish.
*   Simulate real-world user scenarios.
*   Verify that the application meets all requirements.

### 5.4 Test Organization

*   Organize tests into separate directories based on component.
*   Use clear and descriptive test names.
*   Follow a consistent testing style.

### 5.5 Mocking and Stubbing

*   Use mocking to replace external dependencies with controlled substitutes.
*   Use stubbing to provide predefined responses for function calls.
*   Use a mocking library (e.g., `unittest.mock`, `pytest-mock`).

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Gotchas

### 6.1 Frequent Mistakes

*   **Data Leakage:** Accidentally using future information during training.
*   **Incorrect Feature Scaling:** Using inappropriate scaling methods.
*   **Ignoring Categorical Features:**  Not treating categorical features correctly.
*   **Not tuning for imbalanced classes:** Ignoring the need to adjust for imbalanced datasets.
*   **Improper Cross-Validation:** Setting up cross-validation incorrectly.

### 6.2 Edge Cases

*   **Rare Categories:** Handling infrequent categorical values.
*   **Missing Data Patterns:** Understanding the nature and impact of missing data.
*   **Outliers:** Detecting and handling extreme values in your dataset.

### 6.3 Version-Specific Issues

*   Refer to the LightGBM release notes for known issues and bug fixes.
*   Stay up-to-date with the latest version of LightGBM.

### 6.4 Compatibility Concerns

*   Ensure compatibility between LightGBM and other libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas).
*   Address potential conflicts between different versions of dependencies.

### 6.5 Debugging Strategies

*   Use a debugger (e.g., `pdb`) to step through code and inspect variables.
*   Log intermediate values and execution paths.
*   Use assertions to verify expected behavior.
*   Simplify the problem by isolating components.
*   Consult the LightGBM documentation and community forums.
