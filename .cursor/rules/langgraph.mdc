### 1.2. File Naming Conventions

-   Python files: `snake_case.py` (e.g., `customer_support.py`, `retrieval_node.py`).
-   Class names: `PascalCase` (e.g., `CustomerSupportGraph`, `RetrievalNode`).
-   Variables and functions: `snake_case` (e.g., `user_query`, `process_message`).
-   Configuration files: `config.yaml` or `config.json`

### 1.3. Module Organization Best Practices

-   Group related functionalities into modules (e.g., `components`, `graphs`, `utils`).
-   Use `__init__.py` files to make directories packages.
-   Keep modules focused and avoid overly large files.
-   Use relative imports within modules to avoid naming conflicts.

### 1.4. Component Architecture Recommendations

-   Design reusable components for common tasks (e.g., data retrieval, text summarization, tool selection).
-   Create abstract base classes or interfaces for components to promote code reuse and modularity.
-   Use dependency injection to configure components and their dependencies.
-   Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) when designing components.

### 1.5. Code Splitting Strategies

-   Split large graph definitions into smaller, more manageable files.
-   Use lazy loading for components that are not immediately needed.
-   Consider using a module bundler (e.g., esbuild via a plugin) to optimize bundle size for deployment.
-   Break the system down into microservices if warranted by scale and complexity of the overall system. Communicate between microservices using REST or message queues.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 2.1. Design Patterns

-   **State Management Pattern**: Encapsulate the agent state in a dedicated class or data structure to ensure consistency and maintainability. Use LangGraph's `StateGraph` to clearly define the state transitions.
-   **Node Pattern**: Define reusable nodes for common tasks such as information retrieval, tool selection, and response generation.
-   **Conditional Edge Pattern**: Use conditional edges to implement branching logic based on the agent state or external factors. This makes the graph more dynamic and responsive.
-   **Retry Pattern:** Implement retry logic within nodes or edges to handle transient errors or API rate limits.  Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming failing services.
-   **Orchestration Pattern**: Use LangGraph as the orchestrator for complex agentic workflows, delegating specific tasks to specialized components or services.

### 2.2. Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks

-   **Information Retrieval**: Use LangChain's retrieval chain or custom nodes to fetch relevant information from external sources.
-   **Tool Selection**: Implement a tool selection node that dynamically chooses the appropriate tool based on the user query and agent state.
-   **Response Generation**: Use LangChain's LLMChain or custom nodes to generate responses based on the retrieved information and agent state.
-   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within nodes and edges to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent application crashes. Log all errors and implement monitoring to quickly detect and resolve issues.

### 2.3. Anti-patterns and Code Smells

-   **Monolithic Graphs**: Avoid creating overly complex graphs with too many nodes and edges. Break them down into smaller, more manageable subgraphs.
-   **Hardcoded Values**: Avoid hardcoding values directly into the graph definition. Use configuration files or environment variables to manage configurable parameters.
-   **Ignoring Errors**: Always handle exceptions and log errors appropriately. Ignoring errors can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.
-   **Over-Reliance on Global State**: Minimize the use of global state to avoid unintended side effects and make the application more testable.
-   **Lack of Testing**: Thoroughly test all components and graph definitions to ensure they function correctly and handle edge cases.
-   **Infinite Loops:** Ensure the conditional edges within the graph are well-defined to avoid infinite loops.

### 2.4. State Management Best Practices

-   Define a clear and concise agent state schema.
-   Use immutable data structures for the agent state to avoid accidental modifications.
-   Persist the agent state to a database or other storage medium to support long-running conversations or task executions.  Consider using vector databases for efficient retrieval.
-   Implement versioning for the agent state schema to support schema migrations.
-   Use LangGraph's checkpointing feature to save and restore the agent state.

### 2.5. Error Handling Patterns

-   Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions within nodes and edges.
-   Log all errors and warnings with relevant context information.
-   Implement retry logic for transient errors or API rate limits.
-   Use fallback mechanisms to gracefully handle unrecoverable errors.
-   Centralize error handling logic in a dedicated module or class.
-   Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures.

## 3. Performance Considerations

### 3.1. Optimization Techniques

-   **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data or LLM responses.
-   **Batching**: Batch multiple requests to external APIs to reduce latency.
-   **Asynchronous Operations**: Use asynchronous operations to perform non-blocking I/O and improve responsiveness.
-   **Parallel Processing**: Use multi-threading or multi-processing to parallelize computationally intensive tasks.
-   **Graph Optimization**: Optimize the graph structure to minimize the number of nodes and edges.
-   **Prompt Optimization**: Carefully design prompts to reduce the number of tokens and improve LLM performance.
-   **Reduce LLM calls**: Cache LLM responses when possible. Fine-tune smaller models for specific tasks to reduce latency and cost.

### 3.2. Memory Management Considerations

-   Monitor memory usage to detect memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.
-   Use garbage collection to reclaim unused memory.
-   Avoid storing large objects in the agent state.
-   Use streaming or lazy loading for large data sets.

### 3.3. (Not applicable, as LangGraph doesn't directly handle rendering)

### 3.4. Bundle Size Optimization

-   Use a module bundler (e.g., esbuild) to optimize bundle size.
-   Remove unused code and dependencies.
-   Use code splitting to load only the necessary code for each route or component.
-   Compress the bundle using gzip or Brotli.

### 3.5. Lazy Loading Strategies

-   Use lazy loading for components that are not immediately needed.
-   Load large data sets or models on demand.
-   Implement code splitting to load only the necessary code for each graph or component.

## 4. Security Best Practices

### 4.1. Common Vulnerabilities and Prevention

-   **Prompt Injection**: Prevent prompt injection by carefully validating user inputs and sanitizing prompts.
-   **Data Leaks**: Protect sensitive data by encrypting it at rest and in transit.
-   **Unauthorized Access**: Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the application and its data.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Implement rate limiting and request filtering to prevent DoS attacks.
-   **Code Injection**: Avoid executing arbitrary code based on user inputs to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
-   **API Key Exposure**: Store API keys securely using environment variables or a secrets management system and avoid committing them to version control.

### 4.2. Input Validation

-   Validate all user inputs to prevent prompt injection and other vulnerabilities.
-   Use regular expressions or other validation techniques to ensure that inputs conform to the expected format.
-   Sanitize inputs to remove potentially harmful characters or code.
-   Enforce input length limits to prevent buffer overflows.

### 4.3. Authentication and Authorization

-   Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) to verify user identities.
-   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality.
-   Use secure session management to protect user sessions from hijacking.
-   Store passwords securely using hashing and salting.

### 4.4. Data Protection

-   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
-   Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for all API communication.
-   Implement data masking to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
